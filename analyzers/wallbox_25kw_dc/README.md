# Wallbox 25kW DC Charger Analyzer

**Status:** Planned for future development

## Overview

This analyzer will be developed to handle Wallbox 25kW DC charger logs, similar to the Delta AC MAX analyzer.

## Planned Features

- Auto-extraction of log files
- Connection failure detection
- Hardware communication error detection
- Charging session analysis
- Firmware version tracking
- CSV export of results
- Cross-platform support

## Log Structure

To be documented when development begins.

## Development Notes

When implementing this analyzer, consider:
- Log file format and structure specific to Wallbox 25kW DC
- Password protection mechanism (if any)
- Common failure patterns for DC chargers
- OCPP 1.6/2.0.1 message analysis
- Charging session metrics (kWh delivered, duration, etc.)

## Placeholder

This is a placeholder for future development. If you need this analyzer urgently, please contact the development team.
